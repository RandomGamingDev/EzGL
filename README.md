# EzGL

### A powerful graphics library designed to abstract away writing graphics code at 0 cost. Spend time building beautiful, lightway, easy to use, powerful graphics, not fighting the graphics API. 

Please note that this library isn't finished yet and is in prerelease or beta, or whatever u wanna call it. Basically, it isn't done yet. Why? Cause I'm gonna add more stuff ofc!

Compile this with CMake. (This comes with a demo of how you can use this library and its different features this in the Example subdirectory, for which you'll have to create a test.png file in the directory next to the executable for the texture to show)

The default graphics library for this is glad

To choose a different libraries change the target_compile_definitions for EzGL in the EzGL subdirectory

The current available graphics libraries:
glad

The current available graphics APIs:
OpenGL 3

The current available window APIs:
glfw

I'd be glad to accept additions to EzGL to improve the library

EzGL's structure is based on openGL
